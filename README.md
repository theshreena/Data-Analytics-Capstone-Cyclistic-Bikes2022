Cyclistic bikes 

The task consists of performing real world tasks of a Junior data analyst by following data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. 
The director of marketing believes that the company's sucess depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. Understanding how casual and member riders use Cyclistic bikes different will help build a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
The research must be based on compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 
Key Notes:
-The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
-The flexibility of pricing plan includes single ride pass, full day pass and annual memberships.

To find out how can the casual riders convert to member riders we need to follow the process below:
Ask:
Right questions to ask to help convert casual riders to members.
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes different?
2. How many riders did we have in the last 12 months? (Yearly and Monthly)
3. What type of rideable bikes were used? (Yearly and Monthly)
4. What days of the week is the busy day?
5. How long were the duration of the rides?
6. Which are the popular locations for the rides?

These question can help to be focus and head towards the goal.

Prepare:
Used Cyclistic's historical trip data of 12 months provided by Google Data Analytics Course which has been licensed and is appropriate to be used. 
But the limitation is that due to the data privacy issue, it prohibits from using presonal identifiable information and cannot determine if casual riders love in the Cyslistic are or if they have purchased multiple passes. 
Thus, accepting data collected as appropriate, unbias, credible and verified data integrity. 

Process:
Using DataGrip to access data from local PostgreSQL server.
Created divvy database in which tripdata table is loaded from the source provided.
Cleaned, filtered and sorted the data using postgreSQL
Tableau for visualisation
Powerpoint to compile the findings, analyse and recommend. 

Analyze:
Find trend and relationships with the data.
The questions in the ask section answered.
Used calculations and described where necessary.

Share:
Keeping in mind the audience, used tableau to create visualisation and used powerpoint to explain the visulisations.
Shared all the findings in github and is accessible.

Act:
Using guiding questions provided, answered in the powerpoint.
- What is your final conclusion based on your analysis?
- How could your team and business apply your insights?
